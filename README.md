These roles collaborate closely to deliver a robust, scalable, and secure application.


## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend and creating RESTful APIs.
- **Django REST Framework**: A toolkit to build Web APIs easily and efficiently with Django.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database system used to store and manage application data.
- **GraphQL**: A flexible query language and runtime for APIs, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue used for handling background tasks like sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching and session management to improve performance.
- **Docker**: A containerization platform that helps in creating consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment, ensuring efficient testing and delivery of code changes.
